python-lgtv
===========

Simple class for pairing with and controlling your 2012-2015 LG TV with python. 

**This library targets TVs running the older NetCast platform, it does not support WebOS LG TVs. Please see https://github.com/klattimer/LGWebOSRemote if you have a WebOS based device.**

You can find all TVs on the network using the `find_tvs` class method.

```
from lg import Remote

addresses = Remote.find_tvs()
```
If you have only one, it'll be faster to use the `first_only` parameter.

```
address = Remote.find_tvs(first_only=True)
```

You will need a pairing key, if you already know it you can pass it to the `Remote` class' `__init__` otherwise you can create your remote control instance and it'll ask the TV to display it onscreen. You can then provide this pairing key using the `set_pairing_key` method.

```
remote = Remote(address)
# Pairing key will appear on screen
key = raw_input('Please enter pairing key: ')
remote.set_pairing_key(key)
```

After this you can send single or multiple commands using `send_command` and `send_multiple`.

```
remote.send_command(Remote.VOLUME_UP)

commands = [Remote.HOME, Remote.EXIT, Remote.MENU]
remote.send_multiple(commands)
```

An optional `delay` parameter can be provided to `send_multiple`; this will the amount of seconds the control will wait between commands. N.B. Sending commands too fast can cause some of them to be ignored.

A reference of all the shortcut commands available are below, you are free to send any integer with `send_command` but be careful if you don't know what your are doing, as some commands can force the TV in service modes that can be tricky to get back out of.
